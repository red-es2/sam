# Simulated Annealing Research

This repository contains research, experiments, and implementations related to simulated annealingâ€”a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Simulated annealing is widely used for solving complex optimization and combinatorial problems.

## Contents

- **Overview of simulated annealing**: Theory, algorithm, and mathematical background.
- **Implementations**: Code examples and variations in different programming languages.
- **Optimization Strategies**: Techniques to improve solution quality and runtime.
- **Applications**: Use cases in scheduling, routing, and other domains.
- **Experimental Results**: Benchmarks, performance analysis, and visualizations.
- **References**: Key papers and resources for further reading.
